## Invoice Rejections Due to Allocation Numbers
Many callers are experiencing invoice rejections due to issues with allocation numbers not matching records from the tax authority. 

Potential solutions:
- Have the customer send an email with details of the rejection along with a screenshot from the tax authority, and forward this to the Electric Company
- Advise the customer to issue a new allocation number with dates and amounts exactly matching the invoice
- For partnership/union of dealers accounts, invoices need to be issued using the ID number, not the union ID

## Login and Password Issues
Callers frequently have problems logging in or need to reset their passwords.

Streamline the process:
- Verify the company ID number and contact details 
- Release any locks on the account
- Send a temporary password and login details to the customer's registered email
- Advise customers to check for any blocks or restrictions on their computer that may be preventing login

## Registration Process Delays
Some callers have completed the registration form but have not received login details or seen any progress.

Improve communication:
- Check the status of the registration and at what stage it is pending
- Proactively reach out to the customer to acknowledge receipt of their registration 
- Provide clear timelines on when they can expect to receive their login credentials
- Ensure the sales and connections teams are aligned to avoid delays

## Invoice Stuck in Pending
Invoices get stuck in pending status for extended periods causing concern for callers.

Set expectations:
- Explain that pending status indicates the invoice is going through approval cycles at the Electric Company
- Provide a general timeline on how long this process usually takes
- Offer to send a follow-up request to the Electric Company if the delay seems unusually long
- Reassure the customer that payment terms will remain unchanged even with delays in processing

## OCR and Technical Issues
Technical glitches with OCR, digital signatures, servers etc are preventing invoice submission.

Troubleshooting:
- Have the customer try refreshing the page, using a different browser, or retrying at a later time for intermittent issues
- Rescan and resubmit invoices that were rejected due to unreadable supplier details
- Collect details like error messages, screenshots and forward them to the technical team for further investigation
- Inform customers of known issues and advise them to retry once the technical team has resolved it

Implementing these solutions and improving communication can help reduce call volumes and improve customer satisfaction with the Nipendo system support.
